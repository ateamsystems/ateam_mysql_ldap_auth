MySQL auth_ldap is an authentication plugin for the MySQL5 server. It
allows you to create SQL users that are going to be authenticated using
a LDAP server. This allows to minimize administrative duties, since your
users will be able to reuse their existing account to access the
database. The plugin requires MySQL 5.1 and up. It is compiled as an add
on and does not require you to alter MySQL source code, or recompile the
entire server. The plugin add support for LDAP using the OpenLDAP
library.
